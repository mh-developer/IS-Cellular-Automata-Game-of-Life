# Intelligent system with cellular automata and Game of Life simulation

## Main idea

We created intelligent system with cellular automata and extend our idea to Game of Life simulation.

## Content

We tried to simulate algorithms which we learned by the book of Daniel Shiffman.

## 1D cellular automaton

In first part of project, we implements 1D cellular automaton. We include different rules of Wolfram Classification. So you can tried some interesting rulesets, for example rule 90, rule 105, rule 99 and so on.

## Game of Life

In second part we implements well known simulation of "Game of Life".
